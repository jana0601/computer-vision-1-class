Q: What is the difference between the top (coarsest) level of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids? 

A: The coarsest level of the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids are identical. (?)

Q: To make the sharpening work you have to implemen the function amplifyhighfreq2 that amplifies the high-frequency components contained in the finest two levels of the Laplacian pyramid by scaling them up by a factor. Afterwards, implement reconstructlaplacianpyramid that reassembles the pyramid back to obtain a sharpened full-resolution image. Try various amplification factors for both levels and choose those that lead to good or interesting results. You may find that the image noise gets amplified if you scale up the coefficients of the finest sub-band too much; try to avoid that. Briefly explain your findings in answers_problem1.txt.

A:
