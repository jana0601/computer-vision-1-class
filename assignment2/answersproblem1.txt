Q: What is the difference between the top (coarsest) level of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids? 

A: The coarsest level of the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids are identical. The coarsest level of the Laplacian pyramid is simply set to the coarsest level of the Gaussian Pyramid. It thus contains information at the coarsest spacial scale.

Q: To make the sharpening work you have to implemen the function amplifyhighfreq2 that amplifies the high-frequency components contained in the finest two levels of the Laplacian pyramid by scaling them up by a factor. Afterwards, implement reconstructlaplacianpyramid that reassembles the pyramid back to obtain a sharpened full-resolution image. Try various amplification factors for both levels and choose those that lead to good or interesting results. You may find that the image noise gets amplified if you scale up the coefficients of the finest sub-band too much; try to avoid that. Briefly explain your findings in answers_problem1.txt.

A: If the highest-frequency band is amplified too strongly (e.g. with a factor of 2), the image reconstruction looks rather noisy. If it is set too low, it does not look very sharp. After trying out different combinations of amplification factors, we found that settings around 0.5 for the finest level and 1.5 for the second-finest level work well to obtain a sharpened image.
