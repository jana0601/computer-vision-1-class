Question:
Your task is to find a suitable MLP structure with the goal to optimize performance on the test set, i.e. achieving a low test error. Try i) different numbers of layers and ii) different numbers of perceptrons in each layer and keep the best value in your solution. What do you observe when changing i) and ii)? Please provide an analysis in answersproblem2.txt.

Answer:
To obtain the best configuration three different scenarios were testet. 
1. (Varying first hidden layer (5:5:100) Neurons. Fixed second layer N = 30, depth = 2)
2. (Fixed hidden layer N=40, Varying second layer (5:5:100), depth = 2)
3. (Fixed Hidden layers (N=30, N=40), depth = 1:6)

Based on this the following assumptions are made:
- The first hidden layer is capable with N = 15:80 Neurons to classify the problem. If the 2nd layer is fixed at the same time, N = 30.
- With over 80 Neurons in the first hidden layer the neural network become oversensitive, this leads to higher error rates. (First is fixed N = 40)
- The second hidden layer needs more than 50 Neuron for a appropriate representation
- With more than 90 neurons overfitting effects appear
- With more than 3 hidden layers the neural networks becomes oversensitive
