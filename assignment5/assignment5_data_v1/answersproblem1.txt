Question: 
Set K=5 for the k-means clustering, and look at the visualized training features. In answersproblem1.txt, briefy explain one major problem when setting such a low value for the number of codewords in this classification task.
 
Answer:
When K=50, the image categories appear clearly separated in the plot. When lowering the number of codewords to K=5, the image categories do not appear clearly separated. In a bag-of-words model, each feature is mapped to one of the K codewords. This procedure results in a histogram with K bins. For a low number of codewords, there is a lot of ambiguity, which SIFT feature in an image should be assigned to which codeword and thus to which histogram bin. Therefore, our bag-of-words model loses expressiveness, if we only use a small number of codewords.
