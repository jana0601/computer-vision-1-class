The threshold influences several aspects of the panorama image: The Position of the
inliers, warping and the angular of the fitted image. Based on our test with the threshold scales from 0.005 up to 500 (0.005,0.05, .. 50, 500), with three samples for each configuration the following properties could be recognised. Threshold 0.005 can lead to extreme warping effects that literally "destroy" the image, by warping it to strong. An increased threshold leads to more horizontal aligned inliers. Especially in regions, that have higher contrast and more darker pixels.
Increasing the threshold increases, obviously, the amount of best inliers from 4 up 88, in the given samples.
Based on the given samples a threshold of 500, leads to the best outputs. In this case the number of best
inliers is always near 88 (+/- one inlier), the image fits very good and an extreme warping is not recognisable anymore.

Additionally we tested the threshold of 5000 which lead again to problems with the alignment and warping. We assume that the problem exists because of too many constrains, that lead to an „overconstraining-effect“.


Our observations are summarized in this list:

Low threshold (0.005 up to 0.5):
- low number of best inliers (4 to 15)
- poor quality (extreme warping effects)
- low consistency (very different results over different runs)

Medium threshold (0.5 to 5.0):
- more best inliers (15 to 75)
- better quality (but still some heavily warped pictures, especially near image borders)
- better consistency (but still some deviations)

High threshold (5.0 to 500):
- good number of best inliers (75 to 89)
- good quality
- very consistent
