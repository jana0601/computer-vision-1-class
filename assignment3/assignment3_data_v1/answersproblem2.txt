Our observations are summarized in this list:

low threshold (0.005 up to 0.5): 
- low number of best inliers (4 to 15)
- poor quality (extreme warping effects)
- low consinstency (very different results over different runs)

medium threshold (0.5 to 5.0):
- more best inliers (15 to 75)
- better quality (but still some heavily warped pictures, especially near image borders)
- better consistency (but still some deviations)

high threshold (5.0 to 500):
- good number of best inliers (75 to 89)
- good quality
- very consistent
