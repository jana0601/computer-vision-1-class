Question: The conditioning of the image coordinates is an important step of your implementation. What happens if you do not condition the points? What makes the scaling necessary?

Answer:
Without conditioning, the residual error grows by approximately two orders of magnitude. This implies that the fundamental matrix is not estimated as precisely without conditioning. The estimated epipoles are also different by a large margin.
The reason for this is the unequal distribution of the homogeneous coordinates in 3d space. For an image from a typical digital camera, the x and y coordinates lie in the range between 0 and a few thousands. When constructing the matrix for our linear equation system, we multiply two coordinates in these ranges, which increases the range even further. This can make the algorithm numerically unstable, since we lose significant digits if the floating point numbers are not in the same order of magnitude.
