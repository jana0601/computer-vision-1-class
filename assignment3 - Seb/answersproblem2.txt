The threshold influences several aspects of the panorama image: The Position of the
inliers, warping and the angular of the fitted image. Based on the threshold scales
from 0.005 up to 500 (0.005,0.05, .. 50, 500), with three samples for each configuration
the following properties could be recognized. Threshold 0.005 can lead to extreme warping
effects that literally "destroy" the image. An increased threshold leads to more horizontal aligned
inliers. Espacially in regions, that have higher contrast and more darker pixels.
Increasing the threshold increases, obviously, the amount of best inliers from 4 up 88, in the
given samples.
Based on the given samples a threshold of 500, leads to the best outputs. In this case the number of best
inliers is always 88, the image fits very good and an extreme warping is not recognizable anymore.
